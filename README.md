# Learning For All
This is an online tutoring site which can be used by differently abled people. The site can be controlled with facial(head) movements. 

The system uses an open source library to identify facial feature points. 

We have implemented algorithms to identify facial gestures and emotions. 

### Gestures we used in our system

* Move the head to the left and right to change the selection.
